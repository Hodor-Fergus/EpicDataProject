# EpicDataProject

This involves my Internship with Epic Data which lasted 12 weeks.

## Dataset Motivation and Context
In Catalonia, we are currently experiencing a dry period, characterized by reduced precipitation and lower-than-average water levels in reservoirs and rivers as well as in other regions. It's not summer yet and we are already struggling in our water reserve levels, for this reason the local authorities are starting to plan a set of actions (e.g. water supply reductions/cuts) in the following months. Gathering this data, starting from early January and continuosly updating it day by day, will be a great source for further real-time Analysis of the situation, Visualizations of trends, and even the possibility to build short term Prediction Models.

# Technical Information & Resources
## We have 3 major components in this task:
    1. Extracting and storing the data in a database
    2. Analysing and visualising the data
    3. Activating the data with AI & ML
